This program executes the BPC algorithm for the Electric Vehicle Routing and Overnight Charging Scheduling Problem, 
as reported in [Pending].

The program must be in the same path as a "data" file folder, which must contain the instances' files (available on the VRPREP).

To run the algorithms, access the command prompt and run the following command: mE-VRSPTW.exe X Y Z, where 
   - X is the instance name you want to execute (e.g., R101).
   - Y is the number of customers (e.g., 25). 
   - Z is the vehicles' load capacity (e.g., 200)

The solution and log are reported in the corresponding files (in the data folder).
